/// This is the interface that every Article class must implement
/** Additional functions that an Article needs to implement in addition to an
 *  tx_newspaper_ExtraIface.
 * 
 *  Historical notes:\n
 *  Basically I created this class because I want an intermediate stage for the
 *  deployment of tx_newspaper on taz.de. The Source interface returns objects
 *  of class Article, which I can implement in the class taz_article used
 *  in taz 1.0. If Source returned objects of class Article, that would be
 *  incompatible with taz 1.0, and thus messier to migrate.
 * 
 *  As it stands, a separate interface between tx_newspaper_ExtraIface and
 *  tx_newspaper_Article does not seem necessary any more.
 *
 *  \todo Check if this interface can be thrown out altogether.
 *  \todo Actually define the interface. The current functions are just
 *  	preliminary notes.
