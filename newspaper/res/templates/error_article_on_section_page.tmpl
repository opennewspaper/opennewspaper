<h1>Sorry, this won't work out.</h1>

<p>
  The designer of this page, possibly you, tried to place an article display extra on
  a section page.
  This is not going to work, because a section page is <em>defined</em> by the absence
  of an article that is currently displayed. If there is an article to display, an
  article page is displayed. 
</p>

<p>
  Here is the combination of GET parameters that led to this page being displayed:
</p>
<ul>
  {foreach from=$_GET key=key item=value}
    <li>{$key}: {$value}</li>
  {/foreach}
</ul>
